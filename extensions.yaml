    description: |
      A yt extension for analyzing geotagged image files that are loadable with rasterio. 
      The yt_georaster extension combines yt and rasterio, allowing users to query data 
      contained within geometric shapes, like circles, rectangles, and arbitrary polygons 
      saved as Shapefiles. yt_georaster also allows users to load non-trivially overlapping images (e.g., from different satellites) and get back data in a uniform pixelization.

    description: |
      CAESAR is a python-based yt extension package for analyzing the 
      outputs from cosmological simulations. CAESAR takes as input a 
      single snapshot from a simulation, and outputs a portable and 
      compact HDF5 catalog containing a host of galaxy and halo 
      properties that can be read in and explored without the 
      original simulation binary. CAESAR thus provides a simple 
      and intuitive interface for exploring object data within your 
      outputs.
